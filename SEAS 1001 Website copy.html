<h3 style="font-style: italic; text-decoration: underline;">Closing Statement:</h3>
I have thoroughly enjoyed my first semester here at George Washington.
I loved going on the SEAS trip because I felt more relaxed after making
more friends going into classes. The rafting actitivity was my favorite
part about that trip. My social life at college has been going very
well and I find my Intro to Software Development class to be very
interesting. GW has also made me feel more worldy after learning a lot
about the world from people from so many different places on the globe.
I also really liked working with a group on the department project, the
robot, since I had never programmed for something that was actually in
the physical world. It was fascinating seeing how the physical makeup
of the robot would influence how the code would work. <span style="text-decoration: underline; font-style: italic;"><br>
